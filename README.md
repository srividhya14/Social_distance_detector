During the covid 19 pandemic the main priority is the following of covid19 protocols. Social Distancing of 6 feet must be strictly followed between any 2 person. But it has been observed that People are not following social distancing(>6 feet) and are moving in clusters.
To ensure social distancing is maintained strictly , our project monitors the people walking on the streets with the help of CCTV camera / second hand mobile phone cameras.

Developed using :Python , OpenCV , YoloV3

Functionalities of our project:

1.Find the distance between 2 nearest person and classify them as safe (green boxed) or unsafe(red boxed)

2.Give alarm if cluster of people is identified prompting everyone to follow social distancing.

3.Send SMS alert to concerned authorities if the risk factor is found high.
